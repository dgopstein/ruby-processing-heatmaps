A short example of how to create heatmaps in ruby/processing

This code is a direct translation from Philipp Seifried's example in native Processing: http://philippseifried.com/blog/2011/09/30/generating-heatmaps-from-code/

In order to execute this example you will need to install the ruby-processing gem, which in turn depends on JRuby.
